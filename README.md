# Stock Replenishment

The aim of this project is to create a system that allows your shop to restock supplies; the price at which you sell your items is fixed, but you should be able to buy these items from different suppliers based on the order price and shipment days.

The system requires an input, you need to specify the item and the number of pieces you wish to order, the system will them print a table highlighting the cheapest option.
You'll still be able to see other suppliers in case you decide that a shorter shipment time is worth the higher price.

**The** table then prints all of the possible options, with the cheapest supplier highlighted in yellow.
